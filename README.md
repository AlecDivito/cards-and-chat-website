# cards-and-chat-website
<p>This is just a fun little (but becoming big) cards and chat website I am creating. 
I am using vue.js, laravel and bulma.</p>

<p>The whole point is to was to learn how to use vue.js and continue to deepen my understanding of laravel.Its to 
create a working API that my website and others can consume and learn about some of the API's other giant companys 
offer. It is also my first time creating a single page application with vue.js routing. The current hope is to continue working
on the website and slowly add features to chat that will allow users to access facebook, twitter, or other online
web services. Some of the web services I would like it integrate into chat are as followed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">FaceBook</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://watson-api-explorer.mybluemix.net/">Watson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.foaas.com/">FOAAS</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://deckofcardsapi.com/">Cards API</li>
</ul>

<p>More API's will most likely be added in the future, like a service that allows the website to accept credit card 
payments,maybe like paypal to start, so I learn more about ecommerce and puchases over the web</p>
